        Robotic surgery has applications in many medical specialities, including urology, general surgery, and surgical
        oncology. In the conext of a widespread resource and personnel shortage on Low and Middle-Income Countries
        (LMICs), the use of robotics in surgery may help to reduce physician burnout, surgical site infections, and
        hospital stays. However, a lack of haptic feedback and potential socioeconomic factors such as high 
        implementation costs and a lack of trained personnel may limit its accessibility and application. Specific 
        improvements focused on improved financial and technical support to LMICs can help imrpove acess and have the 
        potential to transform the surgical experience for both surgeons and patients in LMICs. This review focuses 
        on the evolution of robotic surgery, with an emphasis on challenges and recommendations to facilitate wider 
        implementation and improved patient outcomes.

        A study has revealed that robotic surgery was involved in 144 deaths and 1,391 injuries in the US during a
        14-year period. While this may seem a cause for concern, considering there were 1.7m operations carried out
        during the same period, this is very few indeed.
        Of course, there is always the possibility of complications occurring in surgery, with or without robot
        involvement. But as robotic procedures become more common, health service users have a reason to wonder what
        these machines do and how complications can occur, so that we can try to prevent them in the future.
        First, are robots really conducting surgical procedures? A more accurate term is robot-assisted surgery. 
        This is a form of keyhole surgery, where the surgeon performs operations using small incisions, through which
        a fibre-optic camera and instruments pass. Keyhole surgery is better for patients as it is less invasive, 
        but can be difficult for surgeons as the long instruments can be awkward to handle.
        Surgeons around the world are now using robot-assisted tech to help them perform minimally invasive
        operations ranging from hernia repair and gall bladder removal to knee replacement and cancer-related
        colectomy, often manipulating the surgical tools from a computer console some distance from the patient. 
        With names like da Vinci, Aquabeam, and Mako, robotic surgical technologies are becoming more common. 
        As an example, industry powerhouse Intuitive reported in late 2021 that the number of surgical procedures
        using its robotic da Vinci system had topped 10 million globally. Surgery performed using a robotic platform
        has led to a step change in how some procedures, largely urological, are delivered. Robotic systems are
        perceived to be advantageous over laparoscopic and open surgery by providing stereoscopic 3D vision with 
        magnification of the surgical field and precise controlled instrument movement to allow dissection in 
        confined spaces and complex manoeuvres such as suturing. That said, the global adoption of robotic surgery
        in other specialities has not been at pace, despite what seem to be clear benefits for patients undergoing
        some complex pelvic and abdominal procedures. Approximately 1.2 million robotic procedures had been
        performed worldwide as of December 2020, most of which were robotic‚Äêassisted radical prostatectomies (RARPs).
        While surgical robots offer multiple advantages, they encounter obstacles such as elevated expenses, 
        restricted availability, and the requirement for specialized training. Ongoing advancements in the field
        seek to tackle these challenges, striving to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of robotic-assisted
        surgery. Concurrently, research is delving into incorporating haptic feedback, augmented reality,
        and autonomous features to augment the functionalities of surgical robots. The incorporation of artificial
        intelligence enriches the functionalities of surgical robots. Through the utilization of machine learning
        algorithms, these robots can analyse extensive datasets, furnishing surgeons with immediate insights and
        decision-making assistance. This not only enhances surgical precision but also paves the way for
        personalized and adaptive methods, customizing procedures based on individual patient characteristics.
        Surgical robots are utilized in a diverse array of medical disciplines. They play a role in urology by 
        assisting in prostatectomies and contribute to gynaecological procedures such as hysterectomies. 
        In orthopaedic surgery, robots aid in joint replacements, and in general surgery, they are involved in
        procedures like hernia repair and colorectal surgery. The adaptability of surgical robots is continually
        growing, showcasing their potential to revolutionize various medical domains.
        Surgical robots embody a revolutionary influence in healthcare, providing exceptional precision and
        broadening the horizons of minimally invasive surgery. With ongoing progress in artificial intelligence
        and robotics, the future holds the prospect of more advanced systems that can revolutionize surgical
        procedures. The continual partnership between technology and medicine has the potential to enhance 
        patient care, redefine surgical benchmarks, and usher in a new era of innovation in healthcare.
