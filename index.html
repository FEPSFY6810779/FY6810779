        Robotic surgery has applications in many medical specialities, including urology, general surgery, and surgical
        oncology. In the conext of a widespread resource and personnel shortage on Low and Middle-Income Countries
        (LMICs), the use of robotics in surgery may help to reduce physician burnout, surgical site infections, and
        hospital stays. However, a lack of haptic feedback and potential socioeconomic factors such as high 
        implementation costs and a lack of trained personnel may limit its accessibility and application. Specific 
        improvements focused on improved financial and technical support to LMICs can help imrpove acess and have the 
        potential to transform the surgical experience for both surgeons and patients in LMICs. This review focuses 
        on the evolution of robotic surgery, with an emphasis on challenges and recommendations to facilitate wider 
        implementation and improved patient outcomes.
