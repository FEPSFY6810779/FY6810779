        Robotic surgery has applications in many medical specialities, including urology, general surgery, and surgical
        oncology. In the conext of a widespread resource and personnel shortage on Low and Middle-Income Countries
        (LMICs), the use of robotics in surgery may help to reduce physician burnout, surgical site infections, and
        hospital stays. However, a lack of haptic feedback and potential socioeconomic factors such as high 
        implementation costs and a lack of trained personnel may limit its accessibility and application. Specific 
        improvements focused on improved financial and technical support to LMICs can help imrpove acess and have the 
        potential to transform the surgical experience for both surgeons and patients in LMICs. This review focuses 
        on the evolution of robotic surgery, with an emphasis on challenges and recommendations to facilitate wider 
        implementation and improved patient outcomes.

        While robots have been in existence for a long while now, their entrance into the realm of medicine is
        relatively novel. In the 1980s the field became popular as a way to do minimally invasive surgery. 
        While laparoscopy already was seeing widespread use, the actions that could be done were relatively
        limited compared to the believed potential of robotic surgery at that time. Also, around that time, 
        the Ames Research Center of NASA started working on the concept of telepresence in surgery. They were
        joined by Stanford in the 1990s which lead to the development of a technologically advanced telemanipulator.
        This served as the building block for future systems. In 1994, AESOP (Computer Motion, Inc., Goleta, CA)
        was FDA approved. AESOP combined a telemanipulator with a foot pedal. Later on, the foot pedal was 
        replaced by voice-control. At that time, however, the functionality was limited.

        Future autonomous surgical robots will have ability to “see,” “think,” and “act” without active human intervention to achieve a predetermined surgical
        goal safely and effectively. Three parameters define the task of an autonomous surgical robot: mission complexity, environmental difficulty, and human independence. 
        To enable this, the autonomous robot possesses visual and physical sensors that perceive the environment, a central processor that receives sensory input and calculates 
        outputs, and mechanical actuators that permit physical task completion. Due to the highly deformable nature of soft tissue environments, the presence of hollow organs 
        susceptible to rupture, and the delicacy of tissues, achieving a clinically viable, versatile autonomous surgical device will require considerable development and integration
        of control algorithms, robotics, computer vision, and smart sensor technology, in addition to extensive trial periods.

        The robot must also be taught how to perform surgery. Proposed methods to “teach” the robots are by directly programming it (explicit learning), or by having the robot directly
        observing a surgeon or video (implicit learning); the robot may even train in virtual reality. Nevertheless, mimicking a human surgeon effectively requires not only ability to
        judge all relevant sensory inputs (ie, visual and tactile features of the surgical field) and positional information, but also a database of explicit knowledge on how to safely
        proceed to achieve the surgical goal. Consequently, it is unlikely that implicit or explicit techniques can be used exclusively, and a combination of both, with continuous 
        reinforcement and modification by domain experts (ie, human surgeons) will be required.

        Robotic surgery offers many benefits to patients compared to open surgery, including:
    - Shorter hospitalization
    - Reduced pain and discomfort
    - Faster recovery time and return to normal activities
    - Smaller incisions, resulting in reduced risk of infection
    - Reduced blood loss and transfusions
    - Minimal scarring

        When performing robotic surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System:
    - The surgeon works from a computer console in the operating room, controlling miniaturized instruments mounted on three robotic arms to make tiny incisions in the patient.
    - The surgeon looks through a 3-D camera attached to a fourth robotic arm, which magnifies the surgical site.
    - The surgeon’s hand, wrist and finger movements are transmitted through the computer console to the instruments attached to the robot’s arms. The mimicked movements have the same range of motion as the surgeon allowing maximum control.

        Surgical procedures performed with the aid of a robot is sometimes marketed as the “best” form of surgery. 
        But a recent review of 50 randomized controlled trials, testing robot-assisted surgeries against 
        conventional methods for abdominal or pelvic procedures, suggests that while there may be some benefits
        to robotic surgery, any advantages over other approaches are modest.

        Firstly the surgeons operate the system using a console that provides a 3D, high-definiton view of the surgical site.
        The console is used with a hand and a foot control that allows the surgeon to manipulate and use the robotic arms and instruments.
        Next, the system has three or four robotic arms, with each arm holding a different surgical instrument.
        The robotic instruments are controlled by the surgeon using the console.
        The endoscope is a tiny camera that provides a much in-depth detailed high-resolution 3D view of the surgical site. 
        The robotic arms have a specialized instrument that mimics the movements of the surgeon's hands with a high degree of precision.

        In conclusion, the surgeon operates from the console, controlling the robotic arms through hand and foot
        controls. The system converts the surgeon's motions into precise movements of the instruments. 
        The system's 3D visualization and increased dexterity are intended to enhance surgical precision, 
        enabling smaller incisions and minimizing patient trauma.

        Some experts express concern about patient safety and surgeon experience, evidence, and cost.
        For instance, in June 2021, researchers released the results of a retrospective study in which they
        determined there is currently no clear advantage with existing robotic platforms. 
        Since robotic-assisted surgery tends to be more expensive and and increases the length of surgical
        procedures, the lack of benefit is certainly worth considering.
        Additionally, in August, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety communication
        reminding patients and healthcare providers that the safety and effectiveness of robotic-assisted surgeries
        for mastectomy procedures, or for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer, have not been established.
